  <p>
    <img src="woman.jpg" alt="thai yoga massage" id="woman">

    Thai-yoga massage is a beautiful and effective healing art. The special yoga based techniques and unique meditative rhythm, make you feel as a whole body-mind-spirit experience. Traditionally a therapy session is performed on a mat on the floor, with the recipient in loose, comfortable clothing.The practitioner will use hands, feet, elbows, thumbs as well as body mechanics and body counter-weight, stretching and many other techniques to adjust body posture, promote blood and energy circulation and allow the patient to relax into a meditative state. During the session a deep relaxation usually develops, the breath slows and deepens, capillaries expand, oxygen feeds every cell of the body, the mind is calm and the body is at rest.Treatment of specific medical conditions is based on the knowledge and skills of Thai-acupressure as an addition to the traditional treatment.

  <p>
    Thai acupressure is an effective, simple and easy to learn method of treatment. It is the most suitable of treating orthopaedic and pain disorders. Thai acupressure is bases on pressing selected point formulas for many common conditions such as: neck pain, shoulder pain, lower back pain, headache and more.
   
  <p>
    thai massage or Thai Massage is an effective way to relieve chronic muscle tension, headaches, neck and back pain, sciatic nerve pain, and digestive disorders, as well as effectively reducing the mental anxiety and physical discomfort brought on by the cumulative effects of everyday stress. 

  <p>
  The results of this work often lasts for days, leaving the receiver with a general sense of calm, openness, and mental clarity, accompanied by the unique feeling of having been plugged-in and recharged - physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

  <p>Thai Massage is unlike any massage you've ever experienced.

  <p>Areas of the body that are tight and tense are worked systematically yet intuitively, with the intent of not only bringing fresh blood and oxygen to exhausted muscle tissue, but to also inspire a greater sense of awareness, as well as a shift in the energy flow through the receivers body. 
  who should receive Thai Massage? Please understand that Thai Massage is not just for the young, athletic, or overly flexible - this form of bodywork can be performed with any body, regardless of age, ability, flexibility, level of pain, or extent of injury, discomfort, disease, or dysfunction.  


  <p>Do you experience discomfort in your body? Pain or aches? Or Are you feeling stressed out and hold all of your tension in your shoulders or lower back? My massages will help you.  Not only will you feel more relaxed, but your muscles, tendons, and bones will be more optimally aligned.


  <p>I will design individualized stretches and exercises to repair the damage caused by repetitive motions such as computer work, driving, and standing for long periods of time.


  <p>Option to lengthen your massage once your on the table. Ask to upgrade 15 or 30 minutes for continued relaxation and more focused time on deep knots and muscle balance!
