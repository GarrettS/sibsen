Navigation: What pages you want to have? We have discussed 1) page about yourself, 2) page about thai massage, 3) contact page. Perhaps also a page more about who you are (i.e. "about me" or "personal"), to delve into you, your beliefs, interests, where you are from, etc.

And so such navigation, from the home page, would look like: 

| Home | [About Thai Massage] | [Personal] | [Contact] 

Nav can go below a header and above the content as a draft template like so:
[header]
[nav]
[content]
[footer]

Header: 
The header would be your name and perhaps a pic of something peaceful (nature, buddhism, etc).

Contents:
The home page should state what you do; possibly more. It should be as simple and to the point. 

Fleshing it out as a first draft homepage, based on the draft template:

| Boonsong Somjit, CMT [nature pic]

| Home | [About Thai Massage] | [Personal] | [Contact] 
|
| [picture of Boonsong] 
| 
| Thai, Swedish, deep tissue, aroma, pregnancy, sports,
