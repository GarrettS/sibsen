      <h2>About Me, Boonsong Somjit</h2>
      <img src="7924349.jpg" alt="Boonsong with Elephant" id="bs-about">
      <p>
        My name is Boonsong Somjit (Song). I was born 
        in Thailand. I began 
        studying Buddhism and meditation in a 
        Buddhist temple at age 14. In 
        2004, I moved to California to teach 
        Meditation and Buddhism. Now I am living in 
        Hawaii to grow my spirit and share what I 
        know to others.
      </p>
   
      <p>
        Besides doing massage, I enjoy photography 
        and design as you see from this website 
        (thank you to my friend, Garret Smith who 
        makes this website as i want it to be). 
        Please feel free to see more of my photos at 
        <a href="http://www.viewbug.com/member/boonsongsomjit">viewbug</a>.
        I also like gardening and cooking in my free 
        time too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have studied Western and Eastern massage 
        styles both in Thailand and in the 
        <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>.  I am 
        still learning this ancient medicine. Our 
        mind and body always have more to learn. 
        Massage, for me, is another way to understand 
        and treat the mind and body. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially in our materialistic urban society, we need massage for life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It feels good to see a smile on someoneâ€™s 
        face after they get massage 
        from me.  A big smile and the words "I feel 
        better now" from you is my 
        goal. Helping and sharing what I know might 
        be one reason while I love 
        to do massage as healing mind and body. Hope 
        to see you soon.

          <p>
            After my first visit to Hyde St. 
            Wellness, I decided to make Thai massage 
            with Song a regular in my life, having 
            felt so profoundly affected by his body 
            work. 
            I have never had a more thorough and 
            transformative massage! He is so very 
            happy, gracious, and humbled to be doing 
            his job - it makes a world of difference.

          <p>
            My massage with Song had just the right 
            amount of pressure and really helped with 
            my lower 
            back and shoulder pain. Plus, the Thai 
            massage room is very relaxing. It is so 
            much more comfortable 
            being on a bed than being on a table with 
            a huge belly, a bunch of pillows, and 
            worrying about 
            falling off! :-) Thank you again!

            The place is beautiful and Song gave me 
            one of the best massages I have ever had. 
            Cannot recommend highly enough and I have 
            been having massages for over 35 years.

            I had the best massage I have ever gotten 
            here - with Song. Very intuitive, alert 
            and aware of what massage techniques I 
            needed. Def will visit again!! My 
            favorite place! 
            The decor is so lovely, not overdone and 
            very, very relaxing! Go here before it 
            gets busy...

          <p>
            I went in for a massage because I was 
            experiencing quite a bit of pain in my 
            back. 
            I don't normally get massages as a matter 
            of practice, but I thought it might help. 
            Song gave me a Swedish massage and it was 
            fantastic. I feel so much better now! 
            Thanks! 
            I will definitely be back again.

              >This place was amazing in every way 
              and seriously, the best massage I have 
              found yet. 
              Song was so good that I feel scared to 
              tell you about him in case you all book 
              with him forever, but I'm sure all of 
              them are just as good :).</a>

            >Stumbled on to Hyde Street Wellness when 
            I was staying in a hotel virtually next 
            door.  What a delight. 
            I was well taken care of from the moment 
            I stepped in the place:  water was 
            offered before, a nice place to
            sit while I drank it, a lovely massage 
            room (the whole space is lovely), very 
            nice robe and towels, 
            including hot moist ones after the 
            massage, along with offers of water, tea 
            and a sauna!   Song's deep
            pressure massage...was exquisite.  He 
            knows nerves as well as muscles, and his 
            demeanor and touch are 
            deeply calming.  Wow.</a>
