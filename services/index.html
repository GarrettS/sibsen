<dt>Thai Massage</dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	The origins of Thai massage date back about 2,500 years.
</p>
<p>
  Thai massage improves health and vitality by using energy lines, pressure points,
  and assisted stretching, helping the body to heal itself.
</p>
<h3>Island Massage / Ashiatsu</h3>
	<p>
        <img src="ashiatsu.jpg">
		The client lies face-down. 
		Coconut oil or lotion is generously applied to the client's back.  
        The therapist uses foot pressure, mostly focusing on the back and hand pressure where needed.
</p>
<p>Island Style massage achieves many of the benefits of deep tissue massage while retaining the relaxing effect of a Swedish massage. 
	</p>

<h3>Jop Sen</h3>
<p>Performed with the client in loose-fitting clothes, Jop Sen massage uses deep pressure along <dfn>sibsen</dfn>, 
	or <dfn>&ldquo;ten energy lines&rdquo;</dfn>, along muscle and tendon, 
	releasing myofascial tension which in turn helps the body to heal itself. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Thai Yoga Massage</h3>
<p>
	The clothed recipient is placed into positions that stretch the body. Elements of Thai 
	Yoga Massage and Jop Sen are often used together in Thai Massage, depending on client needs.
	(see also: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_massage">Thai Massage &mdash; Wikipedia</a>).

<h3>Thai Herbal Massage</h3>

</dd>

<dt>Swedish Massage</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
    Often the signature in spas, this is a classic massage that involves a generous amount of oil, 
    long effleurage strokes of light to medium in pressure. This is the perfect massage 
    if you're looking to unwind or relax. 
 </p>

<p>   
    Swedish massage has been shown to reduce blood pressure, lower stress markers 
        such as cortisol and inflammatory interleukins, 
	    mitigate effects of osteoarthritis and reduce anxiety and increase sense of 
	    confidence and well-being

<!-- dt>Aroma Massage</dt>
<dd>
<p>
	Aroma massage is Swedish massage treatment using essential oils diluted in oil.
</p>
<p>
	<ins>What types of essential oils do you use and for what effects? What base oil do you use? 
		Do you use organic oils?</ins>
</p>
</dd -->
<dt>Deep Tissue Massage</dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	   Deep tissue massage uses strong pressure on deep muscles and connective tissue 
	   in specific areas. Although deep tissue is not a full body massage, 
	   this <em>technique</em> can be incorporated into a full body massage, such as Swedish or Thai.
	</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sports Massage</dt>
<dd><p>
    Deep pressure is applied using hands and feet. 
    Stretches and movements from Thai massage can be used to focus on sports-related problems, to increase 
    resting muscle length, increase blood flow, attenuate muscular imbalance, and even to increase 
    bone mineral density (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20649054">PMID 20649054</a>). 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Pregnancy Massage</dt>

<dd>
<p>
       <img src="pregnancy_massage.jpg">
Relieve the aches and pains that go along with pregnancy. Long gentle strokes, for back, 
hips, legs, and shoulders, ending with a relaxing scalp massage.
</p>
<p>
Pregnancy massage can help reduce swelling, especially in the legs, as well as improve general sense 
of well-being.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Myofascial Release</dt>

<dd>
<p>Myofascial release is soft tissue therapy intended to eliminate pain, increase range of 
motion, increase circulation, and improve posture by working with the fascia. Fascia is 
the connective tissue that connects and covers all muscles, organs, and skeletal structures 
of the body. Direct myofascial release is sometimes known as <dfn>deep tissue work</dfn>. 
</dd>

<dt>Trigger Point Therapy</dt>

<dd>
    <p>Trigger points are small knots in the muscle fibers that often cause a lot of tension. 
    During a session, focused pressure is applied to these areas of tension, until they are 
    released. â€‹
</dd>

<dt>Orthopedic</dt>

<dd>Orthopedic massage is rehabilitative sports massage for painful conditions that affect 
the soft tissues and joints in the body. Orthopedic massage can increase range of motion, 
lubricate joints, and encourage structural balance.
